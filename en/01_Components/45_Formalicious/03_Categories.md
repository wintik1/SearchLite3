Organising your forms from the start is highly recommended. You can do this by creating Form Categories. 
Categories allow you to group forms into tabs.

Create tabs by going to the Formalicious page in the Extras-menu and click on **Admin panel**.

Manage your **Categories** in the first tab. The category-name will be displayed as the tab-name, followed by the description, 
which can be used to explain to your users what the category is used for.
